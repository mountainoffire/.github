Welcome to Mountain Of Fire and Miracles Ministries engineering space :clap:.

### Who or What is Mountain Of Fire
Mountain Of Fire and Miracles Ministries is a full gospel ministry devoted to the Revival of Apostolic Signs, Holy Ghost fireworks and the unlimited demonstration of the power of God to deliver to the uttermost.

Absolute holiness within and without as the greatest spiritual insecticide and a prerequisite for Heaven is taught openly. MFM is a do-it-yourself Gospel ministry where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to do battle.

At MFM, aggressive prayer is considered as an aid to spiritual focus and a check against being overwhelmed by the flesh. At MFM Prayer City, prayer goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, non-stop.

### Coding in Church?
Yes :smiley:, we do have the need to make the lives of the people around us better through technology.
